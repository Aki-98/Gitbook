record","keywords":"","body":"Here is the translation of the provided text into English:\n\nAll Python programs mentioned here are written by myself. Since I only considered my own needs and didn't think about other situations, it would be better to modify them according to your own situation if you want to copy and use them.\n\nCode location: https://github.com/Leah-98/Python-Automation/tree/main/Gitbook\n\nThe biggest advantage of processing your notes into Gitbook is the ability to search globally.\nStep 1: Prepare the MD Note Repository\n1. Convert all files to MD or reference them in MD files\nGitbook can only render Markdown pages.\nSome of my old notes were exported from Evernote and Youdao Cloud, which were in web format. I converted the web format to PDF and referenced it in the README.md folder (append_other_files_to_readme.py).\nThere are also some scattered TXT notes, which I directly changed the suffix to MD (txt_to_md.py).\n2. Place the images referenced in MD in a subfolder at the same level as the MD file, and name the subfolder after the MD file with \"_imgs\" appended\nThe image references in the previous notes were messy. Some were web images, and some were absolute paths written by Typora. When operating on the same note repository on different computers, the absolute paths were inconsistent. Some were placed in the \"imgs\" folder with relative paths, but the \"imgs\" folder was located in various positions within the note repository, making it messy.\nI used a Python program to unify and place them in a subfolder at the same level as the MD file, naming the subfolder after the MD file with \"_imgs\" appended, and rewriting the image references in MD to relative paths (reformat_imgs.py).\nAlso, many of my book excerpts are directly taken from physical books. The phone photos are too large and need to be compressed (compress_pictures.py).\n3. Generate SUMMARY.md\nArrange all MD files and write them in SUMMARY.md. If it's a subfolder and doesn't have README.md, create one yourself (generate_summary.py).\nThis is better than gitbook init, which has various bugs and cannot generate a summary based on all MD files.\nStep 2: Prepare the Gitbook Setup Environment\nI followed some online tutorials and encountered many issues.\n\nThis tutorial is too simple. You can take a look to get a general idea, but don't follow its procedures:\nhttps://tonydeng.github.io/gitbook-zh/\nThis one is more detailed and better:\nhttps://1927344728.github.io/fed-knowledge/tools/Gitbook/\n\n0. Preparing for pitfalls\nAt first, I directly downloaded and installed from the official website:\n\nOfficial website: https://nodejs.org/en\n\nHowever, the version from the official website (v18.x) is too new, causing various adaptation issues with gitbook. Later, I downgraded to v.10.x to use gitbook normally.\nI encountered an error when installing gitbook-cli after installing v18.x version of nodejs and calling gitbook init in the command line:\n/home/travis/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/lib/node_modules/gitbook-cli/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js:287\n      if (cb) cb.apply(this, arguments)\n                 ^\nTypeError: cb.apply is not a function\n    at /home/travis/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/lib/node_modules/gitbook-cli/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js:287:18\n    at FSReqCallback.oncomplete (fs.js:169:5)\n\nSolution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64211386/gitbook-cli-install-error-typeerror-cb-apply-is-not-a-function-inside-graceful\n\nYou need to update the graceful-fs version.\nWhen I tried to update with npm, I encountered another issue where any command would result in an error \"ERR! Cannot read property 'insert' of undefined\".\n\nSolution: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4876\n\nYou need to change the mirror to https://registry.npmmirror.com. If you also need to set a proxy, there is a tutorial here:\n\nSetting npm proxy: https://blog.csdn.net/yanzi1225627/article/details/80247758\n\nAfter updating, calling any gitbook command resulted in no response, no error, and no information. The local directory remained unchanged. I then downgraded nodejs to 10.x.\nDuring this process, there was also an issue that gitbook and gitbook-cli could not coexist. You need to uninstall gitbook to use gitbook-cli (the command-line tool for gitbook). After installing gitbook-cli, the first time you call the gitbook command, like checking the version with gitbook -V, gitbook-cli will install the corresponding version of gitbook.\nSince I got stuck at the \"install gitbook\" step every time I called the gitbook command and checked online for a solution, I found that you can clone gitbook's github repository and then install and link it yourself:\ngit clone https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook.git\ncd gitbook\nnpm install\nnpm link\nFirstly, the instructions in the gitbook repository say to install with bun instead of npm. Secondly, this installation is equivalent to npm install gitbook, which conflicts with gitbook-cli. Therefore, this method is incorrect.\nHere is the correct method:\n1. Install nvm (Node.js version manager) and Node.js v10.x\nChoose one based on your system:\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\n\nbash\nCopy code\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\nInstall Node.js v10.x and use it:\nnvm install 10\nnvm use 10\nI also encountered an issue here. In the above steps, the npm version compatible with Node.js v10.x will be installed. However, I previously used v18.x. After switching to Node.js v10.x, the npm version did not change. Any npm command would result in an error. Later, I switched back to v18, uninstalled npm, which uninstalls the latest version of npm, and then switched to v10.x, allowing me to use the older version of npm.\nnvm use 18\nnpm uninstall npm -g\nThe -g means the operation is carried out globally, which will be used in the following commands.\n2. Install and use gitbook-cli & gitbook\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\nThe npm install -g command is used to globally install Node.js modules. This means the installed modules will be placed in a specific directory, usually the global node_modules directory of your system, not in the node_modules directory of the current project.\nIf you don't use the -g (global) parameter in the npm install command, the command will install the specified package in the node_modules folder of the current project, not in the global environment.\ngitbook -V\nCheck the gitbook version. The first time you call any gitbook command, it will attempt to install gitbook.\nRunning gitbook -V again will show the versions of gitbook-cli and gitbook.\nNote: Do not install gitbook with npm install gitbook directly; use gitbook-cli instead.\n3. Preview the Gitbook website and make adjustments\nSwitch the command line to the root directory of your MD source files and run the following command to automatically generate README.md and SUMMARY.md:\ngitbook init\nNote: Do not include the character \"#\" in the directory names and filenames under the MD files, meaning the generated SUMMARY.md should not contain the \"#\" character. If it does, it will cause the links in the gitbook page's left navigation bar to not work.\nAlso, do not have consecutive curly braces in the MD files, like .\n\nRelated instructions: https://wkcom.gitee.io/gitbook%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8/3%E3%80%81gitbook%E8%BF%9E%E7%BB%AD%E5%A4%A7%E6%8B%AC%E5%8F%B7%E7%9A%84%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F.html\n\nAdding a space between the curly braces will resolve the issue.\nPreview the gitbook website:\ngitbook server\nOpen the local port in the browser to view the page:\nhttp://localhost:4000/\nStep 3: Set up .io online website\nThere are many solutions; I chose to directly upload the static website to Github.\nGenerate the gitbook static website, run the following command in the root directory of your MD source files:\ngitbook build\nThis will generate a _book directory, containing the static website code.\nAs long as the repository has a gh-pages branch, you can access Gitbook Pages with the following link:\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame\nSo the steps are:\n\nCreate an empty Github repository.\nCheck out a gh-pages branch, upload the static website.\nI need multiple gitbooks, so I created a subfolder in the root directory and uploaded the corresponding static website in this subfolder.\n\nThen, I can access multiple Gitbooks with the following paths:\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame/subfoldername1\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame/subfoldername2\nCopyright © Leah 2024 all right reserved，powered by Gitbookmodified time:\n2024-12-11 15:24:40\n"},"English/[Problem Solving]/The program packaged with PyInstaller that depends on apkutils cannot run.html":{"url":"English/[Problem Solving]/The program packaged with PyInstaller that depends on apkutils cannot run.html","title":"The program packaged with pyinstaller that depends on apkutils cannot run","keywords":"","body":"When running the exe, the following error occurs:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"create_release_jira.py\", line 47, in \n  File \"\", line 1176, in _find_and_load\n  File \"\", line 1147, in _find_and_load_unlocked\n  File \"\", line 690, in _load_unlocked\n  File \"PyInstaller\\loader\\pyimod02_importers.py\", line 391, in exec_module\n  File \"submit_gerrit.py\", line 48, in \n  File \"\", line 1176, in _find_and_load\n  File \"\", line 1147, in _find_and_load_unlocked\n  File \"\", line 690, in _load_unlocked\n  File \"PyInstaller\\loader\\pyimod02_importers.py\", line 391, in exec_module\n  File \"mandroid.py\", line 1, in \n  File \"\", line 1176, in _find_and_load\n  File \"\", line 1147, in _find_and_load_unlocked\n  File \"\", line 690, in _load_unlocked\n  File \"PyInstaller\\loader\\pyimod02_importers.py\", line 391, in exec_module\n  File \"apkutils\\__init__.py\", line 1, in \n  File \"\", line 1176, in _find_and_load\n  File \"\", line 1147, in _find_and_load_unlocked\n  File \"\", line 690, in _load_unlocked\n  File \"PyInstaller\\loader\\pyimod02_importers.py\", line 391, in exec_module\n  File \"apkutils\\apk.py\", line 12, in \n  File \"\", line 1176, in _find_and_load\n  File \"\", line 1147, in _find_and_load_unlocked\n  File \"\", line 690, in _load_unlocked\n  File \"PyInstaller\\loader\\pyimod02_importers.py\", line 391, in exec_module\n  File \"apkutils\\axml\\__init__.py\", line 12, in \n  File \"\", line 1176, in _find_and_load\n  File \"\", line 1147, in _find_and_load_unlocked\n  File \"\", line 690, in _load_unlocked\n  File \"PyInstaller\\loader\\pyimod02_importers.py\", line 391, in exec_module\n  File \"apkutils\\axml\\public.py\", line 22, in \n\nException: need to copy the sdk/platforms/android-?/data/res/values/public.xml here\n[6428] Failed to execute script 'create_release_jira' due to unhandled exception!\n\nThe error message to focus on is:\nException: need to copy the sdk/platforms/android-?/data/res/values/public.xml here\nInformation found online: https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/2289\nThe issue was resolved by adding a custom YAML configuration:\n- module-name: \"apkutils.axml\"\n  data-files:\n    patterns:\n      - \"public.xml\"\nThis indicates that the issue is due to apkutils being unable to find the public.xml.\nYou can find the public.xml file in the local site-packages directory, as this file is a dependency of apkutils.\n\nThe error is raised by public.py, which expects the public.xml file to be in the same path.\n\nAlthough PyInstaller does not support YAML configuration, the same effect can be achieved using the --add-data command.\nYou can add the configuration in the PyInstaller command as follows:\npyinstaller --add-data=\"F:\\.dev\\PYTHON\\Lib\\site-packages\\apkutils\\axml\\public.xml;apkutils/axml\" py_source_file.py\nCopyright © Leah 2024 all right reserved，powered by Gitbookmodified time:\n2024-12-06 16:50:09\n"},"English/[Source Code Reading]/[PMS] Why do downgraded system pre-installed applications revert after a reboot.html":{"url":"English/[Source Code Reading]/[PMS] Why do downgraded system pre-installed applications revert after a reboot.html","title":"[pms] why do downgraded system pre-installed applications revert after a reboot","keywords":"","body":"Background\nSystem pre-installed applications are stored in the /system partition.

I consulted the SDK documentation for clarification.\nSDK Documentation:\n\nAndroid Documentation：\n\nIt's evident that there is no corresponding constant value for 0.\nThere's no direct explanation of what passing 0 signifies, but it can be inferred that using other values and combinations of values could yield more information.\nHandling of Flags\nFrom the previous SDK documentation, it's clear that getPackageInfo is an abstract method, so its implementation is not in PackageManager.\nPrinting context.getPackageManager().getClass().getName() reveals that the context.getPackageManager() method returns an ApplicationPackageManager object.\nHere, we cannot yet see how the Android system retrieves PackageInfo, but we can observe the handling of flags.\nApplicationPackageManager.getPackageInfo(String packageName, int flags) -->\n232      @Override\n233      public PackageInfo getPackageInfoAsUser(String packageName, int flags, int userId)\n234              throws NameNotFoundException {\n235          PackageInfo pi =\n236                  getPackageInfoAsUserCached(\n237                          packageName,\n238                          updateFlagsForPackage(flags, userId),\n239                          userId);\n240          if (pi == null) {\n241              throw new NameNotFoundException(packageName);\n242          }\n243          return pi;\n244      }\n\nApplicationPackageManager.updateFlagsForPackage(int flags, int userId)\n1829      /**\n1830       * Update given flags when being used to request {@link PackageInfo}.\n1831       */\n1832      private int updateFlagsForPackage(int flags, int userId) {\n1833          if ((flags & (GET_ACTIVITIES | GET_RECEIVERS | GET_SERVICES | GET_PROVIDERS)) != 0) {\n1834              // Caller is asking for component details, so they'd better be\n1835              // asking for specific Direct Boot matching behavior\n1836              if ((flags & (MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE\n1837                      | MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE\n1838                      | MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AUTO)) == 0) {\n1839                  onImplicitDirectBoot(userId);\n1840              }\n1841          }\n1842          return flags;\n1843      }\n\nFrom the source code reading of the above aspects, it can also be inferred that when the flag is 0, no additional information about the four major components is obtained.\nThe handling of flags exists in various places within the Android system, but all are based on bitwise AND operations. We can conclude that as long as the flags passed in are 0, the flags used when finally obtaining PackageInfo will also be 0.\nObtaining PackageInfo\nRegarding obtaining PackageInfo, Android 11 introduced a caching mechanism. There's an article that explains this change well: https://juejin.cn/post/7004708493634568200\nApart from the caching mechanism, obtaining PackageInfo can ultimately be traced to the getPackageInfoAsUserUncached() method in PackageManager.\nprivate static PackageInfo getPackageInfoAsUserUncached(\n    String packageName, int flags, int userId) {\n    try {\n        return ActivityThread.getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(packageName, flags, userId);\n    } catch (RemoteException e) {\n        throw e.rethrowFromSystemServer();\n    }\n}\n\nBy reading the code of ActivityThread, it can be determined that PackageInfo is obtained through IPackageManager and is acquired by PackageManagerService.\n2345      @UnsupportedAppUsage\n2346      public static IPackageManager getPackageManager() {\n2347          if (sPackageManager != null) {\n2348              return sPackageManager;\n2349          }\n2350          final IBinder b = ServiceManager.getService(\"package\");\n2351          sPackageManager = IPackageManager.Stub.asInterface(b);\n2352          return sPackageManager;\n2353      }\n\nAnd in PackageManagerService, the method responsible for obtaining PackageInfo can ultimately be traced to:\n3400          protected PackageInfo getPackageInfoInternalBody(String packageName, long versionCode,\n3401                  int flags, int filterCallingUid, int userId) {\n3402              // reader\n3403              // Normalize package name to handle renamed packages and static libs\n3404              packageName = resolveInternalPackageNameLPr(packageName, versionCode);\n3405  \n3406              final boolean matchFactoryOnly = (flags & MATCH_FACTORY_ONLY) != 0;\n3407              if (matchFactoryOnly) { //[When flags=0, it doesn't enter here.]\n3408                  // Instant app filtering for APEX modules is ignored\n3409                  if ((flags & MATCH_APEX) != 0) {\n3410                      return mApexManager.getPackageInfo(packageName,\n3411                              ApexManager.MATCH_FACTORY_PACKAGE);\n3412                  }\n3413                  final PackageSetting ps = mSettings.getDisabledSystemPkgLPr(packageName);\n3414                  if (ps != null) {\n3415                      if (filterSharedLibPackageLPr(ps, filterCallingUid, userId, flags)) {\n3416                          return null;\n3417                      }\n3418                      if (shouldFilterApplicationLocked(ps, filterCallingUid, userId)) {\n3419                          return null;\n3420                      }\n3421                      return generatePackageInfo(ps, flags, userId);\n3422                  }\n3423              }\n3424  \n3425              AndroidPackage p = mPackages.get(packageName);\n3426              if (matchFactoryOnly && p != null && !p.isSystem()) {\n3427                  return null;\n3428              }\n3429              if (DEBUG_PACKAGE_INFO)\n3430                  Log.v(TAG, \"getPackageInfo \" + packageName + \": \" + p);\n3431              if (p != null) { \n3432                  final PackageSetting ps = getPackageSetting(p.getPackageName());\n                    // [the flags will be passed in this block]\n3433                  if (filterSharedLibPackageLPr(ps, filterCallingUid, userId, flags)) {  \n3434                      return null;\n3435                  }\n3436                  if (ps != null && shouldFilterApplicationLocked(ps, filterCallingUid, userId)) {\n3437                      return null;\n3438                  }\n3439  \n                    // [the flags will be passed in this block]\n3440                  return generatePackageInfo(ps, flags, userId);\n3441              }\n                    // [This part is not entered when the package is found, only consider the method mentioned above for locating.]\n3442              if (!matchFactoryOnly && (flags & MATCH_KNOWN_PACKAGES) != 0) {\n3443                  final PackageSetting ps = mSettings.getPackageLPr(packageName);\n3444                  if (ps == null) return null;\n3445                  if (filterSharedLibPackageLPr(ps, filterCallingUid, userId, flags)) {\n3446                      return null;\n3447                  }\n3448                  if (shouldFilterApplicationLocked(ps, filterCallingUid, userId)) {\n3449                      return null;\n3450                  }\n3451                  return generatePackageInfo(ps, flags, userId);\n3452              }\n3453              if ((flags & MATCH_APEX) != 0) {\n3454                  return mApexManager.getPackageInfo(packageName, ApexManager.MATCH_ACTIVE_PACKAGE);\n3455              }\n3456              return null;\n3457          }\n\nfilterSharedLibPackageLPr is merely a judgment method, and its method comment is: \"Callers can access only the libs they depend on, otherwise they need to explicitly ask for the shared libraries given the caller is allowed to access all static libs.\"\nThe understanding of this is an access control mechanism.

If the client does not handle this exception, it may lead to a fatal crash, causing the invocation to be lost.\nCountermeasure:\nThe client should implement exception handling to ensure it does not crash.\n\n\nScenario 2: Service Process Throws an Exception Unsupported by AIDL During Method Execution\n\nResult:\nThe AIDL method returns default values on the client side. The client does not receive the exception, the service process does not crash, and the Binder connection remains intact.\nCountermeasure:\nAvoid throwing exception types in the Binder that cannot be processed across processes.\n\n\nScenario 3: Service Process Throws an AIDL-Supported Exception During Method Execution\n\nResult:\nThe exception is forwarded to the client and can be caught in the method call. The invocation is lost, but the service process does not crash. If the client does not shut down, the Binder connection remains intact.\nCountermeasure:\nAvoid throwing exception types in the Binder that cannot be processed across processes.\n\n\nScenario 4: Binder Connection is Broken Before Method Execution\n\nResult:\nThe client triggers a DeadObjectException. If unhandled, it may lead to a fatal crash, causing the invocation to be lost.\nCountermeasure:\nIn the onServiceDisconnected callback, set the Binder reference to null. All Binder calls must first check if the Binder is null.\n\n\nTopic: Only Nine Exception Types are Supported in Binder Inter-Process Communication\n\nIn inter-process communication, only the following nine types of exceptions can be transferred between processes:\nSecurityException\nBadParcelableException\nIllegalArgumentException\nNullPointerException\nIllegalStateException\nNetworkOnMainThreadException\nUnsupportedOperationException\nServiceSpecificException\nParcelable exceptions\n\n\nFor unsupported exceptions, they are handled internally in the program. This may cause crashes, but they will not be passed to the other process. Examples of unsupported exceptions include:\nRuntime exceptions: RuntimeException\nArithmetic exceptions: ArithmeticException\nType casting exceptions: ClassCastException\nArray index out-of-bounds exceptions: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\nFile not found exceptions: FileNotFoundException\nString-to-number conversion exceptions: NumberFormatException\nInput/output exceptions: IOException\nMethod not found exceptions: NoSuchMethodException\n\n\n\n\nTopic: Why Does Binder Only Require a Single Data Copy?\nIn Linux, processes are isolated and cannot communicate directly. When process A sends data to process B, the data is first copied from the user space of A to the kernel space and then from the kernel space to the user space of B.\n\nBinder communication uses the mmap() function to create a memory mapping between the kernel space and the receiving user space's data buffer. This allows process A to copy data directly to the memory buffer mapped to process B's user space, effectively achieving a single data copy.\nAdditionally, as Binder communication is bidirectional, a similar memory mapping is created for the data buffer of process A in the kernel space.\n \nCopyright © Leah 2024 all right reserved，powered by Gitbookmodified time:\n2024-12-11 15:22:18\n"},"English/[Technique Investigation]/Brief Introduction to MediaSession and Command Transmission and Support.html":{"url":"English/[Technique Investigation]/Brief Introduction to MediaSession and Command Transmission and Support.html","title":"Brief introduction to mediasession and command transmission and support","keywords":"","body":"MediaSession-CS Framework\n\nC/S Architecture\nDefines a standard communication interface between the UI and the player in audio/video applications, achieving complete decoupling between the UI and the player.\n\n\n\n\nMediaSession (Server) – Controlled Player Endpoint\n\nManages all communication with the MediaPlayer and hides its APIs from other parts of the application. The system can only access the player through the MediaSession.\nMaintains information such as:\nPlaybackState: Player status (e.g., play/pause).\nMetaData: Related information about the content being played (e.g., title/artist).\n\n\nThe MediaSession can receive callbacks from one or more MediaController instances. The response logic to these callbacks must remain consistent, regardless of which client application initiates them.\n\nMediaController (Client)\n\nThe UI communicates solely with the MediaController. It converts transport control operations into callbacks to the MediaSession. Whenever the session state changes, the MediaController receives callbacks from the MediaSession and can update the UI accordingly.\nA MediaController can connect to only one MediaSession at a time.\nCreating a MediaController requires a pairing token from the controlled endpoint, which means it should be created only after a successful browser connection.\n\n\nMediaSession Authorization Framework\nMediaBrowser (Client)\n\nUsed to connect to the MediaBrowserService and subscribe to data. It allows retrieval of the service connection state and music data via registered callbacks. Typically created on the client side.\n\nMediaBrowserService (Server)\n\nContains two key callbacks:\nonGetRoot: Manages client connection requests and determines whether the client is allowed to connect.\nonLoadChildren: Triggered when a MediaBrowser sends a data subscription request.

Support\nTopic 1: Can you determine if the player supports specific commands via code?\nConclusion: You can determine support for non-custom commands, but not for custom commands.\nExample: Checking Supported Non-Custom Commands\njava复制代码MediaController mediaController = getMediaController(context);\nif (mediaController != null) {\n    PlaybackState playbackState = mediaController.getPlaybackState();\n\n    if (playbackState != null) {\n        long actions = playbackState.getActions();\n\n        if ((actions & PlaybackState.ACTION_PLAY) != 0) {\n

}\n}\n\nTopic 2: Can you determine if the player successfully executed a command via code?\nConclusion: You can only determine the success of certain commands (e.g., play/pause) using PlaybackState, but there are no callbacks for commands like next/previous.\nExample: Checking Command Execution Success\njava复制代码// Assume a MediaController instance exists\nMediaController mediaController = ...;\n\n// Create and register a Callback to listen for state changes\nMediaController.Callback callback = new MediaController.Callback() {\n    @Override\n    public void

      Log.d(\"MediaController\", \"Playback stopped.\");\n                    break;\n                case PlaybackState.STATE_ERROR:\n                    Log.e(\"MediaController\", \"Playback error:

准备md笔记仓库\n1.将所有文件处理成md，或引用到md文件中\ngitbook是只能够渲染markdown页面的。\n我之前的笔记里，有一部分比较古早的笔记来自evernote、有道云的导出，是网页格式。网页格式我就转成PDF了，引用写在除了根目录的README.md文件夹下（append_other_files_to_readme.py）。\n还有些零零散散的txt笔记，就直接将后缀改成md了（txt_to_md.py）\n2.将md引用的图片放置在md文件的同级目录的子文件夹下，子文件夹命名为md文件的名字_imgs\n之前的笔记引用图片比较混乱，有的是网络图片，有的是typora帮我写了绝对路径，但是在各个电脑上操作同一个笔记仓库，绝对路径不一致，有的以相对路径放在imgs文件夹下，但imgs文件夹在笔记仓库的各个位置，也比较乱。\n还是用python程序处理，统一放置到md文件的同级目录的子文件夹下，子文件夹命名为md文件的名字_imgs，md里的图片引用重写为相对路径（reformat_imgs.py）\n另外我自己的书摘很多时候是直接拍的实体书，手机照片太大了，需要压缩下（compress_pictures.py）\n3.生成SUMMARY.md\n将所有的md文件按文件路径写好SUMMARY.md，如果是子文件夹且没有README.md，则自己创建一个（generate_summary.py）\n比gitbook init会好用一些，gitbook init生成文件有各种bug，且没办法根据所有md文件生成summary\n第二步 准备Gitbook搭建环境\n直接看的网络上的教程，踩了一堆坑。\n\n这个教程太简单了，可以先看一遍了解一下大概，但不要按里面的流程走\nhttps://tonydeng.github.io/gitbook-zh/\n这个更详细更好\nhttps://1927344728.github.io/fed-knowledge/tools/Gitbook/\n\n0.踩坑前置\n刚开始直接去官网下载安装的\n\n官网：https://nodejs.org/en\n\n但是官网这个版本(v18.x)太新了，gitbook有各种适配问题，后来降级成(v.10.x才正常使用gitbook)\n讲一下踩坑过程吧，使用v18.x版本的nodejs，安装gitbook-cli后，在命令行调用gitbook init，报错：\n/home/travis/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/lib/node_modules/gitbook-cli/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js:287\n      if (cb) cb.apply(this, arguments)\n                 ^\nTypeError: cb.apply is not a function\n    at /home/travis/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/lib/node_modules/gitbook-cli/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js:287:18\n    at FSReqCallback.oncomplete (fs.js:169:5)\n\n\n解决方法：https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64211386/gitbook-cli-install-error-typeerror-cb-apply-is-not-a-function-inside-graceful\n\n需要更新下graceful-fs版本\n我使用npm更新的时候还踩了个坑，调用任何命令都是报错 ERR! Cannot read property 'insert' of undefined\n\n解决方法：https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4876\n\n就是需要修改镜像到https://registry.npmmirror.com\n如果还需要设置proxy的话，这里有教程\n\nnpm设置代理：https://blog.csdn.net/yanzi1225627/article/details/80247758\n\n更新完之后，gitbook 调用任何命令没有反应，没有报错没有任何信息，本地目录没有任何变化，之后就将nodejs降级成了10.x\n期间还有一个坑，gitbook和gitbook-cli是不能共存的，使用gitbook-cli(gitbook的命令行工具)得把gitbook卸载掉，安装完gitbook-cli第一次调用gitbook命令时，gitbook -V这种看版本号的也算，gitbook-cli就会去安装对应版本的gitbook\n因为我每次调用gitbook命令，都会卡在install gitbook这一步，查了下网上的方法，可以克隆gitbook的github仓库然后自己install自己link\ngit clone https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook.git\ncd gitbook\nnpm install\nnpm link\n\n首先gitbook仓库里面的说明是使用bun安装而不是npm，其次这样安装还是相当于npm install gitbook，gitbook和gitbook-cli是冲突的，所以这个方法是错的。\n下面说正确的方法\n1.安装nvm(nodejs的版本管理工具)和10.x版本的nodejs\n根据自己系统的情况二者选一\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\n\nbash\nCopy code\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\n\n安装nodejs 10.x版本并使用\nnvm install 10\nnvm use 10\n\n这里还踩了个坑，上面的步骤中会安装nodejs 10.x版本适配的npm，但是我之前使用的18.x版本，切换使用nodejs 10.x版本后，npm的版本没有切换，调用npm任何命令都会报错，后来且切换回使用18版本，再卸载npm，这里的卸载操作会卸载最新版本npm，切换使用10.x版本后，就能正常使用到较低版本的npm了\nnvm use 18\nnpm uninstall npm -g\n\n-g的意思是将操作实施到全局，这个命令之后也会用到\n2.安装使用gitbook-cli&gitbook\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\n\nnpm install -g 命令用于全局安装 Node.js 模块。这意味着安装的模块将被放置在一个特定的目录中，通常是你的系统的全局 node_modules 目录下，而不是当前项目的 node_modules 目录下。\n如果在 npm install 命令中不使用 -g（全局）参数，那么该命令将会在当前项目目录下的 node_modules 文件夹中安装指定的包，而不是在全局环境中安装。\ngitbook -V\n\n查看gitbook版本，第一次调用任何gitbook命令会去安装gitbook\n再次运行gitbook -V可以看到gitbook-cli和gitbook的版本\n注意不要自己npm install gitbook，要通过gitbook-cli\n3.预览gitbook网站，进行修复\n将命令行切换到自己的自己的md源文件根目录下，运行下面的命令自动生成README.md、SUMMARY.md\n建议跑脚本，gitbook init生成文件有各种bug，且没办法根据所有md文件生成summary\ngitbook init\n\n注意目录下md文件和子文件不要包含“#”这个字符，也就是说生成的SUMMARY.md引用中不要有“#”字符，如果有的话会导致生成的gitbook页面点击左部的相应导航条目无法跳转\n另外md文件中任何位置不要有连续的大括号，比如\n\n相关说明：https://wkcom.gitee.io/gitbook%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8/3%E3%80%81gitbook%E8%BF%9E%E7%BB%AD%E5%A4%A7%E6%8B%AC%E5%8F%B7%E7%9A%84%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F.html\n\n大括号中间加个空格就能解决\n预览gitbook网站\ngitbook server\n\n在浏览器打开本地端口page查看\nhttp://localhost:4000/\n\n第三步 搭建.io在线网站\n有很多解决方案，我选择直接在Github上传静态网站。\n生成gitbook静态网站，在自己的md源文件根目录下运行：\ngitbook build\n\n会生成个_book目录，里面放置的就是静态网站代码\n只要仓库里有gh-pages分支，就可以根据下面的连接访问Gitbook Pages\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame\n\n所以步骤就是：\n\n创建个空的github仓库\n切出个gh-pages分支，上传静态网站\n我需要多个gitbook，所以我在根目录下创建个子文件夹，在这个子文件夹下上传对应的静态网站\n\n那我就可以根据下面路径访问多个Gitbook\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame/subfoldername1\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame/subfoldername2\n\nCopyright

PlaybackState.STATE_PLAYING:\n                   Log.d(\"MediaController\", \"Playback started successfully.\");\n                   break;\n               case PlaybackState.STATE_PAUSED:\n                   Log.d(\"MediaController\", \"Playback is paused.\");\n                   break;\n               case PlaybackState.STATE_STOPPED:\n                   Log.d(\"MediaController\", \"Playback stopped.\");\n                   break;\n               case PlaybackState.STATE_ERROR:\n                   Log.e(\"MediaController\", \"Playback encountered an error: \" + state.getErrorMessage());\n                   break;\n               // 其他状态可以根据需要处理\n               default:\n                   Log.d(\"MediaController\", \"Playback state changed: \" + playbackState);\n                   break;\n          }\n      }\n  }\n};\n\n// 注册 Callback\nmediaController.registerCallback(callback);\n\n// 执行播放操作\nmediaController.getTransportControls().play();\n\n// 在适当的时候注销 Callback\n// mediaController.unregisterCallback(callback);\n\nCopyright © Leah 2024 all right reserved，powered by Gitbookmodified time:\n2024-12-11
