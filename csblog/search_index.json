Since I only considered my own needs and didn't think about other situations, it would be better to modify them according to your own situation if you want to copy and use them.\n\nCode location: https://github.com/Leah-98/Python-Automation/tree/main/Gitbook\n\nThe biggest advantage of processing your notes into Gitbook is the ability to search globally.\nStep 1: Prepare the MD Note Repository\n1. Convert all files to MD or reference them in MD files\nGitbook can only render Markdown pages.\nSome of my old notes were exported from Evernote and Youdao Cloud, which were in web format. I converted the web format to PDF and referenced it in the README.md folder (append_other_files_to_readme.py).\nThere are also some scattered TXT notes, which I directly changed the suffix to MD (txt_to_md.py).\n2. Place the images referenced in MD in a subfolder at the same level as the MD file, and name the subfolder after the MD file with \"_imgs\" appended\nThe image references in the previous notes were messy. Some were web images, and some were absolute paths written by Typora. When operating on the same note repository on different computers, the absolute paths were inconsistent. Some were placed in the \"imgs\" folder with relative paths, but the \"imgs\" folder was located in various positions within the note repository, making it messy.\nI used a Python program to unify and place them in a subfolder at the same level as the MD file, naming the subfolder after the MD file with \"_imgs\" appended, and rewriting the image references in MD to relative paths (reformat_imgs.py).\nAlso, many of my book excerpts are directly taken from physical books. The phone photos are too large and need to be compressed (compress_pictures.py).\n3. Generate SUMMARY.md\nArrange all MD files and write them in SUMMARY.md. If it's a subfolder and doesn't have README.md, create one yourself (generate_summary.py).\nThis is better than gitbook init, which has various bugs and cannot generate a summary based on all MD files.\nStep 2: Prepare the Gitbook Setup Environment\nI followed some online tutorials and encountered many issues.\n\nThis tutorial is too simple. You can take a look to get a general idea, but don't follow its procedures:\nhttps://tonydeng.github.io/gitbook-zh/\nThis one is more detailed and better:\nhttps://1927344728.github.io/fed-knowledge/tools/Gitbook/\n\n0. Preparing for pitfalls\nAt first, I directly downloaded and installed from the official website:\n\nOfficial website: https://nodejs.org/en\n\nHowever, the version from the official website (v18.x) is too new, causing various adaptation issues with gitbook. Later, I downgraded to v.10.x to use gitbook normally.\nI encountered an error when installing gitbook-cli after installing v18.x version of nodejs and calling gitbook init in the command line:\nshellCopy code/home/travis/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/lib/node_modules/gitbook-cli/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js:287\n      if (cb) cb.apply(this, arguments)\n                 ^\nTypeError: cb.apply is not a function\n    at /home/travis/.nvm/versions/node/v12.18.3/lib/node_modules/gitbook-cli/node_modules/npm/node_modules/graceful-fs/polyfills.js:287:18\n    at FSReqCallback.oncomplete (fs.js:169:5)\n\nSolution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64211386/gitbook-cli-install-error-typeerror-cb-apply-is-not-a-function-inside-graceful\n\nYou need to update the graceful-fs version.\nWhen I tried to update with npm, I encountered another issue where any command would result in an error \"ERR! Cannot read property 'insert' of undefined\".\n\nSolution: https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4876\n\nYou need to change the mirror to https://registry.npmmirror.com. If you also need to set a proxy, there is a tutorial here:\n\nSetting npm proxy: https://blog.csdn.net/yanzi1225627/article/details/80247758\n\nAfter updating, calling any gitbook command resulted in no response, no error, and no information. The local directory remained unchanged. I then downgraded nodejs to 10.x.\nDuring this process, there was also an issue that gitbook and gitbook-cli could not coexist. You need to uninstall gitbook to use gitbook-cli (the command-line tool for gitbook). After installing gitbook-cli, the first time you call the gitbook command, like checking the version with gitbook -V, gitbook-cli will install the corresponding version of gitbook.\nSince I got stuck at the \"install gitbook\" step every time I called the gitbook command and checked online for a solution, I found that you can clone gitbook's github repository and then install and link it yourself:\nshellCopy codegit clone https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook.git\ncd gitbook\nnpm install\nnpm link\nFirstly, the instructions in the gitbook repository say to install with bun instead of npm. Secondly, this installation is equivalent to npm install gitbook, which conflicts with gitbook-cli. Therefore, this method is incorrect.\nHere is the correct method:\n1. Install nvm (Node.js version manager) and Node.js v10.x\nChoose one based on your system:\nshellCopy codecurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\n\nbash\nCopy code\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\nInstall Node.js v10.x and use it:\nshellCopy codenvm install 10\nnvm use 10\nI also encountered an issue here. In the above steps, the npm version compatible with Node.js v10.x will be installed. However, I previously used v18.x. After switching to Node.js v10.x, the npm version did not change. Any npm command would result in an error. Later, I switched back to v18, uninstalled npm, which uninstalls the latest version of npm, and then switched to v10.x, allowing me to use the older version of npm.\nshellCopy codenvm use 18\nnpm uninstall npm -g\nThe -g means the operation is carried out globally, which will be used in the following commands.\n2. Install and use gitbook-cli & gitbook\nshellCopy code\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\nThe npm install -g command is used to globally install Node.js modules. This means the installed modules will be placed in a specific directory, usually the global node_modules directory of your system, not in the node_modules directory of the current project.\nIf you don't use the -g (global) parameter in the npm install command, the command will install the specified package in the node_modules folder of the current project, not in the global environment.\nshellCopy code\ngitbook -V\nCheck the gitbook version. The first time you call any gitbook command, it will attempt to install gitbook.\nRunning gitbook -V again will show the versions of gitbook-cli and gitbook.\nNote: Do not install gitbook with npm install gitbook directly; use gitbook-cli instead.\n3. Preview the Gitbook website and make adjustments\nSwitch the command line to the root directory of your MD source files and run the following command to automatically generate README.md and SUMMARY.md:\nshellCopy code\ngitbook init\nNote: Do not include the character \"#\" in the directory names and filenames under the MD files, meaning the generated SUMMARY.md should not contain the \"#\" character. If it does, it will cause the links in the gitbook page's left navigation bar to not work.\nAlso, do not have consecutive curly braces in the MD files, like .\n\nRelated instructions: https://wkcom.gitee.io/gitbook%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8/3%E3%80%81gitbook%E8%BF%9E%E7%BB%AD%E5%A4%A7%E6%8B%AC%E5%8F%B7%E7%9A%84%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F.html\n\nAdding a space between the curly braces will resolve the issue.\nPreview the gitbook website:\nshellCopy code\ngitbook server\nOpen the local port in the browser to view the page:\nshellCopy code\nhttp://localhost:4000/\nStep 3: Set up .io online website\nThere are many solutions; I chose to directly upload the static website to Github.\nGenerate the gitbook static website, run the following command in the root directory of your MD source files:\nshellCopy code\ngitbook build\nThis will generate a _book directory, containing the static website code.\nAs long as the repository has a gh-pages branch, you can access Gitbook Pages with the following link:\nshellCopy code\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame\nSo the steps are:\n\nCreate an empty Github repository.\nCheck out a gh-pages branch, upload the static website.\nI need multiple gitbooks, so I created a subfolder in the root directory and uploaded the corresponding static website in this subfolder.\n\nThen, I can access multiple Gitbooks with the following paths:\nshellCopy codehttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame/subfoldername1\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame/subfoldername2\nI haven't found a method yet to generate multiple gitbook websites under the same Github user.\n"},"English/[Source Code Reading]/":{"url":"English/[Source Code Reading]/","title":"[source code reading]","keywords":"","body":"[source code reading]\n"},"English/[Source Code Reading]/What does passing 0 to PackageManager.getPackageInfo as a Flag mean.html":{"url":"English/[Source Code Reading]/What does passing 0 to PackageManager.getPackageInfo as a Flag mean.html","title":"What does passing 0 to packagemanager.getpackageinfo as a flag mean","keywords":"","body":"Environment\nAndroid SDK 31（Android 12）\nBackground\nThe issue arose from the following line of code in the project :\nPackageManager packageManager = context.getPackageManager();\nPackageInfo info = packageManager.getPackageInfo(context.getPackageName(), 0);\n\nThe 0 used as a flag parameter is flagged by PM Challenge, suggesting that Android constants should be used instead of integer values. I consulted the SDK documentation for clarification.\nSDK Documentation:\n\nAndroid Documentation：\n\nIt's evident that there is no corresponding constant value for 0.\nThere's no direct explanation of what passing 0 signifies, but it can be inferred that using other values and combinations of values could yield more information.\nHandling of Flags\nFrom the previous SDK documentation, it's clear that getPackageInfo is an abstract method, so its implementation is not in PackageManager.\nPrinting context.getPackageManager().getClass().getName() reveals that the context.getPackageManager() method returns an ApplicationPackageManager object.\nHere, we cannot yet see how the Android system retrieves PackageInfo, but we can observe the handling of flags.\nApplicationPackageManager.getPackageInfo(String packageName, int flags) -->\n232      @Override\n233      public PackageInfo getPackageInfoAsUser(String packageName, int flags, int userId)\n234              throws NameNotFoundException {\n235          PackageInfo pi =\n236                  getPackageInfoAsUserCached(\n237                          packageName,\n238                          updateFlagsForPackage(flags, userId),\n239                          userId);\n240          if (pi == null) {\n241              throw new NameNotFoundException(packageName);\n242          }\n243          return pi;\n244      }\n\nApplicationPackageManager.updateFlagsForPackage(int flags, int userId)\n1829      /**\n1830       * Update given flags when being used to request {@link PackageInfo}.\n1831       */\n1832      private int updateFlagsForPackage(int flags, int userId) {\n1833          if ((flags & (GET_ACTIVITIES | GET_RECEIVERS | GET_SERVICES | GET_PROVIDERS)) != 0) {\n1834              // Caller is asking for component details, so they'd better be\n1835              // asking for specific Direct Boot matching behavior\n1836              if ((flags & (MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_UNAWARE\n1837                      | MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AWARE\n1838                      | MATCH_DIRECT_BOOT_AUTO)) == 0) {\n1839                  onImplicitDirectBoot(userId);\n1840              }\n1841          }\n1842          return flags;\n1843      }\n\nFrom the source code reading of the above aspects, it can also be inferred that when the flag is 0, no additional information about the four major components is obtained.\nThe handling of flags exists in various places within the Android system, but all are based on bitwise AND operations. We can conclude that as long as the flags passed in are 0, the flags used when finally obtaining PackageInfo will also be 0.\nObtaining PackageInfo\nRegarding obtaining PackageInfo, Android 11 introduced a caching mechanism. There's an article that explains this change well: https://juejin.cn/post/7004708493634568200\nApart from the caching mechanism, obtaining PackageInfo can ultimately be traced to the getPackageInfoAsUserUncached() method in PackageManager.\nprivate static PackageInfo getPackageInfoAsUserUncached(\n    String packageName, int flags, int userId) {\n    try {\n        return ActivityThread.getPackageManager().getPackageInfo(packageName, flags, userId);\n    } catch (RemoteException e) {\n        throw e.rethrowFromSystemServer();\n    }\n}\n\nBy reading the code of ActivityThread, it can be determined that PackageInfo is obtained through IPackageManager and is acquired by PackageManagerService.\n2345      @UnsupportedAppUsage\n2346      public static IPackageManager getPackageManager() {\n2347          if (sPackageManager != null) {\n2348              return sPackageManager;\n2349          }\n2350          final IBinder b = ServiceManager.getService(\"package\");\n2351          sPackageManager = IPackageManager.Stub.asInterface(b);\n2352          return sPackageManager;\n2353      }\n\nAnd in PackageManagerService, the method responsible for obtaining PackageInfo can ultimately be traced to:\n3400          protected PackageInfo getPackageInfoInternalBody(String packageName, long versionCode,\n3401                  int flags, int filterCallingUid, int userId) {\n3402              // reader\n3403              // Normalize package name to handle renamed packages and static libs\n3404              packageName = resolveInternalPackageNameLPr(packageName, versionCode);\n3405  \n3406              final boolean matchFactoryOnly = (flags & MATCH_FACTORY_ONLY) != 0;\n3407              if (matchFactoryOnly) { //[When flags=0, it doesn't enter here.]\n3408                  // Instant app filtering for APEX modules is ignored\n3409                  if ((flags & MATCH_APEX) != 0) {\n3410                      return mApexManager.getPackageInfo(packageName,\n3411                              ApexManager.MATCH_FACTORY_PACKAGE);\n3412                  }\n3413                  final PackageSetting ps = mSettings.getDisabledSystemPkgLPr(packageName);\n3414                  if (ps != null) {\n3415                      if (filterSharedLibPackageLPr(ps, filterCallingUid, userId, flags)) {\n3416                          return null;\n3417                      }\n3418                      if (shouldFilterApplicationLocked(ps, filterCallingUid, userId)) {\n3419                          return null;\n3420                      }\n3421                      return generatePackageInfo(ps, flags, userId);\n3422                  }\n3423              }\n3424  \n3425              AndroidPackage p = mPackages.get(packageName);\n3426              if (matchFactoryOnly && p != null && !p.isSystem()) {\n3427                  return null;\n3428              }\n3429              if (DEBUG_PACKAGE_INFO)\n3430                  Log.v(TAG, \"getPackageInfo \" + packageName + \": \" + p);\n3431              if (p != null) { \n3432                  final PackageSetting ps = getPackageSetting(p.getPackageName());\n                    // [the flags will be passed in this block]\n3433                  if (filterSharedLibPackageLPr(ps, filterCallingUid, userId, flags)) {  \n3434                      return null;\n3435                  }\n3436                  if (ps != null && shouldFilterApplicationLocked(ps, filterCallingUid, userId)) {\n3437                      return null;\n3438                  }\n3439  \n                    // [the flags will be passed in this block]\n3440                  return generatePackageInfo(ps, flags, userId);\n3441              }\n                    // [This part is not entered when the package is found, only consider the method mentioned above for locating.]\n3442              if (!matchFactoryOnly && (flags & MATCH_KNOWN_PACKAGES) != 0) {\n3443                  final PackageSetting ps = mSettings.getPackageLPr(packageName);\n3444                  if (ps == null) return null;\n3445                  if (filterSharedLibPackageLPr(ps, filterCallingUid, userId, flags)) {\n3446                      return null;\n3447                  }\n3448                  if (shouldFilterApplicationLocked(ps, filterCallingUid, userId)) {\n3449                      return null;\n3450                  }\n3451                  return generatePackageInfo(ps, flags, userId);\n3452              }\n3453              if ((flags & MATCH_APEX) != 0) {\n3454                  return mApexManager.getPackageInfo(packageName, ApexManager.MATCH_ACTIVE_PACKAGE);\n3455              }\n3456              return null;\n3457          }\n\nfilterSharedLibPackageLPr is merely a judgment method, and its method comment is: \"Callers can access only the libs they depend on, otherwise they need to explicitly ask for the shared libraries given the caller is allowed to access all static libs.\"\nThe understanding of this is an access control mechanism.

Cannot read property 'insert' of undefined\n\n解决方法：https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4876\n\n就是需要修改镜像到https://registry.npmmirror.com\n如果还需要设置proxy的话，这里有教程\n\nnpm设置代理：https://blog.csdn.net/yanzi1225627/article/details/80247758\n\n更新完之后，gitbook 调用任何命令没有反应，没有报错没有任何信息，本地目录没有任何变化，之后就将nodejs降级成了10.x\n期间还有一个坑，gitbook和gitbook-cli是不能共存的，使用gitbook-cli(gitbook的命令行工具)得把gitbook卸载掉，安装完gitbook-cli第一次调用gitbook命令时，gitbook -V这种看版本号的也算，gitbook-cli就会去安装对应版本的gitbook\n因为我每次调用gitbook命令，都会卡在install gitbook这一步，查了下网上的方法，可以克隆gitbook的github仓库然后自己install自己link\ngit clone https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook.git\ncd gitbook\nnpm install\nnpm link\n\n首先gitbook仓库里面的说明是使用bun安装而不是npm，其次这样安装还是相当于npm install gitbook，gitbook和gitbook-cli是冲突的，所以这个方法是错的。\n下面说正确的方法\n1.安装nvm(nodejs的版本管理工具)和10.x版本的nodejs\n根据自己系统的情况二者选一\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\n\nbash\nCopy code\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash\n\n安装nodejs 10.x版本并使用\nnvm install 10\nnvm use 10\n\n这里还踩了个坑，上面的步骤中会安装nodejs 10.x版本适配的npm，但是我之前使用的18.x版本，切换使用nodejs 10.x版本后，npm的版本没有切换，调用npm任何命令都会报错，后来且切换回使用18版本，再卸载npm，这里的卸载操作会卸载最新版本npm，切换使用10.x版本后，就能正常使用到较低版本的npm了\nnvm use 18\nnpm uninstall npm -g\n\n-g的意思是将操作实施到全局，这个命令之后也会用到\n2.安装使用gitbook-cli&gitbook\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\n\nnpm install -g 命令用于全局安装 Node.js 模块。这意味着安装的模块将被放置在一个特定的目录中，通常是你的系统的全局 node_modules 目录下，而不是当前项目的 node_modules 目录下。\n如果在 npm install 命令中不使用 -g（全局）参数，那么该命令将会在当前项目目录下的 node_modules 文件夹中安装指定的包，而不是在全局环境中安装。\ngitbook -V\n\n查看gitbook版本，第一次调用任何gitbook命令会去安装gitbook\n再次运行gitbook -V可以看到gitbook-cli和gitbook的版本\n注意不要自己npm install gitbook，要通过gitbook-cli\n3.预览gitbook网站，进行修复\n将命令行切换到自己的自己的md源文件根目录下，运行下面的命令自动生成README.md、SUMMARY.md\n建议跑脚本，gitbook init生成文件有各种bug，且没办法根据所有md文件生成summary\ngitbook init\n\n注意目录下md文件和子文件不要包含“#”这个字符，也就是说生成的SUMMARY.md引用中不要有“#”字符，如果有的话会导致生成的gitbook页面点击左部的相应导航条目无法跳转\n另外md文件中任何位置不要有连续的大括号，比如\n\n相关说明：https://wkcom.gitee.io/gitbook%E7%9A%84%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8/3%E3%80%81gitbook%E8%BF%9E%E7%BB%AD%E5%A4%A7%E6%8B%AC%E5%8F%B7%E7%9A%84%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F.html\n\n大括号中间加个空格就能解决\n预览gitbook网站\ngitbook server\n\n在浏览器打开本地端口page查看\nhttp://localhost:4000/\n\n第三步 搭建.io在线网站\n有很多解决方案，我选择直接在Github上传静态网站。\n生成gitbook静态网站，在自己的md源文件根目录下运行：\ngitbook build\n\n会生成个_book目录，里面放置的就是静态网站代码\n只要仓库里有gh-pages分支，就可以根据下面的连接访问Gitbook Pages\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame\n\n所以步骤就是：\n\n创建个空的github仓库\n切出个gh-pages分支，上传静态网站\n我需要多个gitbook，所以我在根目录下创建个子文件夹，在这个子文件夹下上传对应的静态网站\n\n那我就可以根据下面路径访问多个Gitbook\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame/subfoldername1\nhttps://githubusername.github.io/reponame/subfoldername2\n\n暂时没有找到多个github仓库生成同一githubuser下多个gitbook网站的方法\n"},"中文/【源码阅读】/":{"url":"中文/【源码阅读】/","title":"【源码阅读】","keywords":"","body":"【源码阅读】\n"}}}
